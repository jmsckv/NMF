# NMF
Topic Modelling via NMF -  Solution to an assignment in the course Data Mining and Matrices at the University of Mannheim. 

The PDF file contains the discussion of the findings/observations when repeatedly running NMF and e.g. comparing it to the SVD. 

The R file contains the code to reproduce the results.

The ground truth topics are being derived from a subset of the 20 Newsgroup dataset (4 topics in total).
